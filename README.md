# simple-todo-app
It is a typical To-do app where a user can input future to-do's and remove them when completed

### front-end
The UI is built with html and css
I've used font awesome to get some logos
<p>
<img src="images/app.png" alt="Image of the app" width="400" height="300">
</p>


### back-end
Firebase is used as the backend <br />
Firebase is a backend-as-a-service, so you can configure it for your app as needed <br />
I've used its cloud database (firestore) to store the ToDo's of the app
